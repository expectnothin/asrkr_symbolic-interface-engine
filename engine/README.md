# ⚙️ Source Code Engine

All core implementations of the **Symbolic Interaction Engine (SIE)** reside here.  
When the rituals have a body, this is it.

## Contents (to be added)
- Parser for symbolic triggers
- Interpreter and memory handler
- Stateless registry runtime

> The engine runs not on logic alone — but on meaning.
>
> # Engine (`/engine`)

This folder houses the symbolic execution engine — all core logic, parsing, and transformation layers.

## Key Modules (suggested)
- `registry_loader.py` – Loads and validates symbolic registry files
- `ritual_compiler.py` – Builds executable ritual objects
- `symbolic_parser.py` – Translates plain prompts into symbolic form
- `auth_protocols.py` – Stateless authentication mechanisms (optional)

## Design Principles
- Stateless
- Symbolic-first
- Modular and expandable

> This is the nuclear core. Don't poke without gloves.
