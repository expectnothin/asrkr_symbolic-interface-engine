# ⚙️ Source Code Engine

All core implementations of the **Symbolic Interaction Engine (SIE)** reside here.  
When the rituals have a body, this is it.

## Contents (to be added)
- Parser for symbolic triggers
- Interpreter and memory handler
- Stateless registry runtime

> The engine runs not on logic alone — but on meaning.
